     Reads a TIFF file as input.  Produces a portable anymap as  output.   The
     type  of  the  output  file  depends  on the input file - if it's black &
     white, a _p_b_m file is written, else if it's grayscale a _p_g_m file,  else  a
     _p_p_m file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

          Dump TIFF file information  to  stderr.   This  information  may  be
          useful in debugging TIFF file conversion problems.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

     This program is not self-contained.  To use it you must  fetch  the  TIFF
     Software  package  listed in the OTHER.SYSTEMS file and configure PBMPLUS
     to  use  libtiff.   See  PBMPLUS's   Makefile   for   details   on   this
     configuration.

     This program is a twisty little maze of #ifdefs, all different.
