     Reads a portable bitmap as input.  If no input-file  is  given,  standard
     input is assumed.  Produces a MacPaint file as output.

     The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will  need  a
     program  such  as  _m_c_v_e_r_t  to  generate a Macbinary or a BinHex file that
     contains the necessary information to identify the file as a PNTG file to
     MacOS.

     Left, right, bottom & top let you define a square into the pbm file, that
     must  be converted.  Default is the whole file.  If the file is too large
     for a MacPaint-file, the bitmap is cut to fit from ( left, top ).
