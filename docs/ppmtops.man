     Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces  Encapsulated  PostScript  as
     output,  using the colorimage operator.  This operator is only defined on
     color printers and very recent B&W printers.  Most of the time  you  will
     NOT want to use ppmtops; instead, do a ppppppmmmtttooopppgggmmm ||| pppgggmmmtttooopppsss.

     Note that there is no pstoppm tool  -  this  transformation  is  one-way,
     because  a  pstoppm  tool would be a full-fledged PostScript interpreter,
     which is beyond the scope of this package.

          Controls the scale of the result.  The default scale is 1, which  on
          a  300  dpi  printer  such as the Apple LaserWriter makes the output
          look about the same size as the input would if it was displayed on a
          typical 72 dpi screen.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
