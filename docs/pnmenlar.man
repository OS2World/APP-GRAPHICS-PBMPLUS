     Reads a portable anymap as input.  Replicates its  pixels  _N  times,  and
     produces a portable anymap as output.

     _p_n_m_e_n_l_a_r_g_e can only enlarge by integer  factors.   The  slower  but  more
     general  _p_n_m_s_c_a_l_e  can  enlarge  or  reduce  by  arbitrary  factors,  and
     _p_b_m_r_e_d_u_c_e can reduce by integer factors, but only for bitmaps.

     If you enlarge by a factor of 3  or  more,  you  should  probably  add  a
     _p_n_m_s_m_o_o_t_h  step;  otherwise,  you  can  see  the  original  pixels in the
     resulting image.
