     Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Produces a file of Gemini 10X  printer
     graphics as output.  The 10x's printer codes are alleged to be similar to
     the Epson codes.

     Note that there is no 10xtopbm tool - this transformation is one way.

     The resolution is normally 60H by 72V.  If  the  ---hhh  flag  is  specified,
     resolution  is  120H by 144V.  You may find it useful to rotate landscape
     images before printing.
