     Reads a PICT file (version 1 or 2) and outputs a portable pixmap.  Useful
     as  the first step in converting a scanned image to something that can be
     displayed on Unix.

     ---vvv   Turns on verbose mode which prints a a whole  bunch  of  information
          that only _p_i_c_t_t_o_p_p_m hackers really care about.

     The PICT file  format  is  a  general  drawing  format.   _p_i_c_t_t_o_p_p_m  only
     supports  a  small  subset of its operations but is still very useful for
     files produced by scanning software.  In  particular,  text  added  to  a
     scanned image will be silently ignored.
