     Reads two portable anymaps as input.  Inserts the first anymap  into  the
     second at the specified location, and produces a portable anymap the same
     size as the second as output.  If the second anymap is not specified,  it
     is  read from stdin.  The _x and _y can be negative, in which case they are
     interpreted relative to the right and bottom of the anymap, respectively.

     This tool is most useful in combination with _p_n_m_c_u_t.   For  instance,  if
     you  want to edit a small segment of a large image, and your image editor
     is TOO STUPID to edit the large image, you can cut out  the  segment  you
     are interested in, edit it, and then paste it back in.

     The _p_b_m_p_a_s_t_e tool is like this one, except that since it only has to work
     with bitmaps, it implements bitblt-style logical operations.
