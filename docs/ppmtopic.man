     Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces  a  Macintosh  PICT  file  as
     output.

     The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will  need  a
     program  such  as  _m_c_v_e_r_t  to  generate a Macbinary or a BinHex file that
     contains the necessary information to identify the file as a PICT file to
     MacOS.

     Even though PICT supports 2  and  4  bits  per  pixel,  _p_p_m_t_o_p_i_c_t  always
     generates an 8 bits per pixel file.

     The picture size field is only correct if the output is to a  file  since
     writing  into  this  field requires seeking backwards on a file.  However
     the PICT documentation seems to suggest that this field is  not  critical
     anyway since it is only the lower 16 bits of the picture size.
