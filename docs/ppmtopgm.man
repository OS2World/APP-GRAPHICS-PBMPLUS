     Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a portable graymap as output.
     The quantization formula used is .299 r + .587 g + .114 b.

     Note that although there is a _p_g_m_t_o_p_p_m program, it is not  necessary  for
     simple  conversions from _p_g_m to _p_p_m, because any ppm program can read _p_g_m
     (and _p_b_m ) files automagically.  _p_g_m_t_o_p_p_m is for colorizing a  _p_g_m  file.
     Also, see _p_p_m_t_o_r_g_b_3 for a different way of converting color to gray.

     Cold-hearted orb that rules the night
     Removes the colors from our sight
     Red is gray, and yellow white
     But we decide which is right
     And which is a quantization error.
