     Reads two portable anymaps as input.  Performs the  specified  arithmetic
     operation,  and  produces  a  portable  anymap  as output.  The two input
     anymaps must be the same width and height.

     The arithmetic is performed  between  corresponding  pixels  in  the  two
     anymaps, with maxval as 1.0, black as 0.0, and a linear scale in between.
     Results that fall outside of [0..1) are truncated.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
