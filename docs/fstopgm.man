     Reads a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file as input.  Produces a portable  graymap
     as output.

     FaceSaver(tm) files sometimes have  rectangular  pixels.   While  _f_s_t_o_p_g_m
     won't  re-scale  them  into  square  pixels for you, it will give you the
     precise _p_n_m_s_c_a_l_e command that will do the job.  Because of this,  reading
     a FaceSaver(tm) image is a two-step process.  First you do:
       fstopgm > /dev/null
     This will tell you whether you need to use _p_n_m_s_c_a_l_e. Then use one of  the
     following pipelines:
       fstopgm | pgmnorm
       fstopgm | pnmscale -whatever | pgmnorm
     To go to PBM, you want something more like one of these:
       fstopgm | pnmenlarge -3 | pgmnorm | pgmtopbm
       fstopgm | pnmenlarge -3 | pnmscale -whatever | pgmnorm | pgmtopbm
     You want to enlarge when going to a bitmap  because  otherwise  you  lose
     information; but enlarging by more than 3 does not look good.
