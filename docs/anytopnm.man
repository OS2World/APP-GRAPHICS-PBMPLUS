     Uses the _f_i_l_e program, possibly  augmented  by  the  magic  numbers  file
     included  with  PBMPLUS,  to try to figure out what type of image file it
     is.  If that fails (very few image formats have magic numbers), looks  at
     the filename extension.  If that fails, punts.

     The type of the output file depends on the input file.

     It's a script.  Scripts are not portable to non-Unix environments.
