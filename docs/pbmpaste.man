     Reads two portable bitmaps as input.  Inserts the first bitmap  into  the
     second at the specified location, and produces a portable bitmap the same
     size as the second as output.  If the second bitmap is not specified,  it
     is  read from stdin.  The _x and _y can be negative, in which case they are
     interpreted relative to the right and bottom of the bitmap, respectively.

     This tool is useful in combination with _p_n_m_c_u_t.   For  instance,  if  you
     want to edit a small segment of a large bitmap, and your bitmap editor is
     TOO STUPID to edit the large bitmap, you can cut out the segment you  are
     interested in, edit it, and then paste it back in.

     Another useful companion tool is _p_b_m_m_a_s_k.

     The _p_n_m_p_a_s_t_e tool is like this one, except that it doesn't implement  the
     logical  operation  flags,  since  they don't have any useful meaning for
     grayscale and color images.

     The flags specify the operation to use when doing the paste.  The default
     is  ---rrreeeppplllaaaccceee.   The other operations act as if white is 1 and black is 0.
     WARNING: this is the opposite of how the PBM  file  format  stores  bits.
     Ignore the file format.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
