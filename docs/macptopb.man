          This  flag  is  to  get  around  a  problem  with  some  methods  of
          transferring  files  from  the Mac world to the Unix world.  Most of
          these methods leave the Mac files alone, but a few of them  add  the
          "finderinfo"  data  onto  the front of the Unix file.  This means an
          extra 128 bytes to skip over when reading the file.  The symptom  to
          watch  for is that the resulting PBM file looks shifted to one side.
          If you get this, try ---eeexxxtttrrraaassskkkiiippp 128, and if that still doesn't  look
          right try another value.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
