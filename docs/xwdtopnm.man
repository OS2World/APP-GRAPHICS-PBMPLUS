     Reads a X11 or X10 window dump file as input.  Produces a portable anymap
     as  output.   The  type of the output file depends on the input file - if
     it's black & white, a _p_b_m file is written, else if it's grayscale  a  _p_g_m
     file, else a _p_p_m file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

     Using this program, you can convert anything on an X workstation's screen
     into  an  anymap.  Just display whatever you're interested in, do an xwd,
     run it through xwdtopnm, and then use pnmcut to select the part you want.

     I haven't tested this tool with very many configurations,  so  there  are
     probably bugs.  Please let me know if you find any.

     This program is a twisty little maze of #ifdefs, all different.
