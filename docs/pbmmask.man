     Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Creates a  corresponding  mask  bitmap
     and writes it out.

     The color to be interpreted as "background" is determined  automatically.
     Regardless of which color is background, the mask will be white where the
     background is and black where the figure is.

     This lets you do a masked paste like  this,  for  objects  with  a  black
     background:
         pbmmask obj > objmask
         pbmpaste < dest -and objmask <x> <y> | pbmpaste -or obj <x> <y>
     For objects with a white background, you can either invert them or add  a
     step:
         pbmmask obj > objmask
         pnminvert objmask | pbmpaste -and obj 0 0 > blackback
         pbmpaste < dest -and objmask <x> <y> | pbmpaste -or blackback <x> <y>
     Note  that  this  three-step  version  works  for  objects   with   black
     backgrounds too, if you don't care about the wasted time.

     You can also use masks with graymaps  and  pixmaps,  using  the  _p_n_m_a_r_i_t_h
     tool.  For instance:
         ppmtopgm obj.ppm | pgmtopbm -threshold | pbmmask > objmask.pbm
         pnmarith -multiply dest.ppm objmask.pbm > t1.ppm
         pnminvert objmask.pbm | pnmarith -multiply obj.ppm - > t2.ppm
         pnmarith -add t1.ppm t2.ppm
     An interesting variation  on  this  is  to  pipe  the  mask  through  the
     _p_n_m_s_m_o_o_t_h  script  before  using it.  This makes the boundary between the
     two images less sharp.

     ---eeexxxpppaaannnddd
          Expands the mask by one pixel out from the image.  This is useful if
          you  want  a  little  white  border  around  your  image.  (A better
          solution might be to turn the _p_b_m_l_i_f_e tool into a  general  cellular
          automaton tool...)
