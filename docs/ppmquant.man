     Reads a portable  pixmap  as  input.   Chooses  _n_c_o_l_o_r_s  colors  to  best
     represent the image, maps the existing colors to the new ones, and writes
     a portable pixmap as output.

     The quantization method is Heckbert's "median cut".

     Alternately, you can skip the color-choosing step by specifying your  own
     set of colors with the ---mmmaaappp flag.  The _m_a_p_f_i_l_e is just a _p_p_m file; it can
     be any shape, all that matters is the colors in  it.   For  instance,  to
     quantize down to the 8-color IBM TTL color set, you might use:
         P3
         8 1
         255
           0   0   0
         255   0   0
           0 255   0
           0   0 255
         255 255   0
         255   0 255
           0 255 255
         255 255 255

     The ---fffllloooyyyddd/-fffsss flag  enables  a  Floyd-Steinberg  error  diffusion  step.
     Floyd-Steinberg   gives   vastly  better  results  on  images  where  the
     unmodified quantization has banding or other artifacts,  especially  when
     going to a small number of colors such as the above IBM set.  However, it
     does take substantially more CPU time, so the default is off.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
