     The portable pixmap format is a lowest  common  denominator  color  image
     file format.  The definition is as follows:

     - A "magic number" for identifying the file type.   A  ppm  file's  magic
       number is the two characters "P3".

     - Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

     - A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.

     - Whitespace.

     - A height, again in ASCII decimal.

     - Whitespace.

     - The maximum color-component value, again in ASCII decimal.

     - Whitespace.

     - Width * height pixels, each three ASCII decimal values  between  0  and
       the  specified  maximum  value,  starting at the top-left corner of the
       pixmap, proceding in normal English reading order.   The  three  values
       for each pixel represent red, green, and blue, respectively; a value of
       0 means that color is off, and the maximum value means  that  color  is
       maxxed out.

     - Characters from a "#" to the next end-of-line are ignored (comments).

     - No line should be longer than 70 characters.

     Here is an example of a small pixmap in this format:
     P3
     # feep.ppm
     4 4
     15
      0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0   15  0 15
      0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0    0  0  0
      0  0  0    0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0
     15  0 15    0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0

     Programs that  read  this  format  should  be  as  lenient  as  possible,
     accepting anything that looks remotely like a pixmap.

     There is also a variant on the format, available by setting  the  RAWBITS
     option at compile time.  This variant is different in the following ways:

     - The "magic number" is "P6" instead of "P3".

     - The pixel values are stored as plain bytes, instead of ASCII decimal.

     - Whitespace is not allowed  in  the  pixels  area,  and  only  a  single
       character  of  whitespace  (typically  a  newline) is allowed after the
       maxval.

     - The files are smaller and many times faster to read and write.

     Note that this raw format can only be used for maxvals less than or equal
     to 255.  If you use the _p_p_m library and try to write a file with a larger
     maxval, it will automatically fall back on the slower  but  more  general
     plain format.
