     Reads a portable graymap as input.  Produces Encapsulated  PostScript  as
     output.

     Note that there is no pstopgm tool  -  this  transformation  is  one-way,
     because  a  pstopgm  tool would be a full-fledged PostScript interpreter,
     which is beyond the scope of this package.  However,  see  the  _p_s_i_d_t_o_p_g_m
     tool.

     The ---ssscccaaallleee flag controls the scale of the result.  The default  scale  is
     1,  which  on  a  300 dpi printer such as the Apple LaserWriter makes the
     output look about the same size as the input would if it was displayed on
     a typical 72 dpi screen.

     The ---rrrllleee or ---rrruuunnnllleeennngggttthhh flag specifies run-length compression.   This  may
     save time if the host-to-printer link is slow; but normally the printer's
     processing time dominates, so ---rrrllleee makes things slower.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
