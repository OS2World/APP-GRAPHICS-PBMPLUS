     Reads two portable anymaps as input.   Convolves  the  second  using  the
     first, and writes a portable anymap as output.

     Convolution means replacing each pixel with a  weighted  average  of  the
     nearby pixels.  The weights and the area to average are determined by the
     convolution matrix.  The unsigned numbers in  the  convolution  file  are
     offset  by  -maxval/2 to make signed numbers, and then normalized, so the
     actual values in the convolution file are only relative.

     Here is a sample convolution file;  it  does  a  simple  average  of  the
     immediate neighbors, resulting in a smoothed image:
         P2
         3 3
         18
         10 10 10
         10 10 10
         10 10 10

     The convolution file will usually be a bitmap or  graymap  instead  of  a
     pixmap,  so  that  the  same  convolution  gets  applied  to  each  color
     component.  However, if you want to use  a  pixmap  and  do  a  different
     convolution to different colors, you can certainly do that.
