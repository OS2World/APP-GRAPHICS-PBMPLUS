     ppmquantall - run ppmquant on a bunch of files all at once, so they share
     a common colormap

     Takes a bunch of portable pixmap as input.   Chooses  _n_c_o_l_o_r_s  colors  to
     best  represent  all  of  the images, maps the existing colors to the new
     ones, and ooovvveeerrrwwwrrriiittteeesss ttthhheee iiinnnpppuuuttt fffiiillleeesss with the new quantized versions.

     Verbose explanation: Let's say you've got a dozen pixmaps that  you  want
     to  display  on  the  screen  all at the same time.  Your screen can only
     display 256 different colors, but the pixmaps have a total of a  thousand
     or  so different colors.  For a single pixmap you solve this problem with
     _p_p_m_q_u_a_n_t; this script solves it for multiple pixmaps.   All  it  does  is
     concatenate  them together into one big pixmap, run _p_p_m_q_u_a_n_t on that, and
     then split it up into little pixmaps again.

     (Note that another way to solve this problem is to pre-select  a  set  of
     colors  and  then  use _p_p_m_q_u_a_n_t's ---mmmaaappp option to separately quantize each
     pixmap to that set.)

     It's a csh script.  Csh scripts are not portable to System V.  Scripts in
     general are not portable to non-Unix environments.
