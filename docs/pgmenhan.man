     Reads a portable graymap as input.  Enhances  the  edges,  and  writes  a
     portable graymap as output.

     The edge enhancing technique is taken from  Philip  R.  Thompson's  "xim"
     program,  which  in  turn took it from section 6 of "Digital Halftones by
     Dot Diffusion", D. E. Knuth, ACM Transaction on Graphics Vol. 6,  No.  4,
     October  1987,  which in turn got it from two 1976 papers by J. F. Jarvis
     et. al.
