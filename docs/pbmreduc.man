     Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Reduces it  by  a  factor  of  _N,  and
     produces a portable bitmap as output.

     _p_b_m_r_e_d_u_c_e duplicates a lot of the functionality of _p_g_m_t_o_p_b_m; you could do
     something like pppnnnmmmssscccaaallleee ||| pppgggmmmtttooopppbbbmmm,,, but _p_b_m_r_e_d_u_c_e is a lot faster.

     _p_b_m_r_e_d_u_c_e can be used to "re-halftone" an image.  Let's say  you  have  a
     scanner  that  only  produces  black&white,  not grayscale, and it does a
     terrible job of halftoning (most b&w scanners fit this description).  One
     way  to fix the halftoning is to scan at the highest possible resolution,
     say 300 dpi, and then reduce by a factor of three or so using  _p_b_m_r_e_d_u_c_e.
     You  can  even  correct  the  brightness of an image, by using the ---vvvaaallluuueee
     flag.

     By  default,  the  halftoning   after   the   reduction   is   done   via
     boustrophedonic  Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion; however, the ---ttthhhrrreeessshhhooolllddd
     flag can be used to  specify  simple  thresholding.   This  gives  better
     results when reducing line drawings.

     The ---vvvaaallluuueee flag alters the thresholding value for all quantizations.   It
     should  be a real number between 0 and 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images;
     below 0.5 means lighter.

     All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
