     Reads a portable graymap as input.  Colorizes it by multiplying  the  the
     gray  values by specified color or colors, and produces a portable pixmap
     as output.

     If only one color is specified, black in the pgm  file  stays  black  and
     white in the pgm file turns into the specified color in the ppm file.  If
     two colors (separated by a dash) are specified, then black gets mapped to
     the first color and white gets mapped to the second.

     The colors can be specified in three ways.  One, as a name, assuming that
     a  pointer  to an X11-style color names file was compiled in.  Two, as an
     X11-style   hexidecimal   number:   #rgb,   #rrggbb,    #rrrgggbbb,    or
     #rrrrggggbbbb.   Three,  as  a  triplet of decimal floating point numbers
     separated by commas: r.r,g.g,b.b.

     Also, the ---mmmaaappp flag lets you specify an entire colormap to be used.   The
     mapfile  is just a _p_p_m file; it can be any shape, all that matters is the
     colors in it and their order.  In this case, black gets mapped  into  the
     first color in the map file, and white gets mapped to the last.
