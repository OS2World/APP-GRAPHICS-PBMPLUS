     Reads a portable graymap as input.  Produces a  Lisp  Machine  bitmap  as
     output.

     This is the file format read by the tv:read-bit-array-file function on TI
     Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.

     Given a pgm (instead of a pbm) a multi-plane image will be output.   This
     is probably not useful unless you have a color lisp machine.

     Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image  file
     format  does  not  include  a color map, so we must treat it as a graymap
     instead.  This is unfortunate.

     Output width is always rounded up to the nearest  multiple  of  32;  this
     might  not  always be what you want, but it probably is (arrays which are
     not modulo 32 cannot be passed to the Lispm  BITBLT  function,  and  thus
     cannot easilly be displayed on the screen).

     No color.
