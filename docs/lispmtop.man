     Reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input.  Produces  a  portable  graymap  as
     output.

     This is the file format written by the  tv:write-bit-array-file  function
     on TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.

     Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image  file
     format  does  not  include  a color map, so we must treat it as a graymap
     instead.  This is unfortunate.

     The Lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky;  Usually the image  in  the
     file  has its width rounded up to the next higher multiple of 32, but not
     always.  If the width is not a multiple of 32,  we  don't  deal  with  it
     properly,  but  because  of the Lispm microcode, such arrays are probably
     not image data anyway.

     Also, the lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in  that  if  you  are
     writing  a bitmap which is not mod32 across, the file may be up to 7 bits
     too short!  They round down instead of up, and we don't handle  this  bug
     gracefully.

     No color.
