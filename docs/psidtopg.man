     Reads the "image" data from a  PostScript  file  as  input.   Produces  a
     portable graymap as output.

     This is a very simple and limited program, and is here  only  because  so
     many  people  have  asked for it.  To use it you have to mmmaaannnuuuaaallllllyyy extract
     the readhexstring data portion from your PostScript file, and  then  give
     the  width,  height,  and  bits/sample  on  the command line.  Before you
     attempt this, you should aaattt llleeeaaasssttt read the  description  of  the  "image"
     operator in the PostScript Language Reference Manual.

     It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this filter
     to  read a specific variety of PostScript image, but the variation is too
     great to make a general-purpose reader.  Unless, of course, you  want  to
     write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
