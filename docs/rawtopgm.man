     Reads raw grayscale bytes as  input.   Produces  a  portable  graymap  as
     output.  The input file is just grayscale bytes.  You have to specify the
     width and height on the command line, since the program  obviously  can't
     get  them  from  the  file.   The  maxval  is  assumed to be 255.  If the
     resulting image is upside down, run it through pppnnnmmmfffllliiippp ---tttbbb ...

          If the file has a header, you can use this flag to skip over it.

          If there is padding at the ends of the rows, you can  skip  it  with
          this  flag.   Note  that rowskip can be a real number.  Amazingly, I
          once had an image with 0.376 bytes of padding per row.  This  turned
          out  to  be  due to a file-transfer problem, but I was still able to
          read the image.
